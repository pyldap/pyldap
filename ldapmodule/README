LDAP module for Python
======================

This module provides access to the LDAP (C language) library.
It is known to compile and work with:
  * UM LDAP library v3.3, ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap.tar.Z
  * OpenLDAP release 1.2.7, http://www.openldap.org/

For extensive module usage documentation, look in the Doc directory.

Standard build instructions:
    sh configure
    make
    make install  (possibly)

Quick usage example:
    import ldap
    l = ldap.open("my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

Not included:
   Direct BER support
   CLDAP 

Author contact:
   (I am really hoping that someone will add the CLDAP support and 
   possibly the OpenLDAP extensions such as display templates to this
   library. If you are interested, please contact me at:)

Notes for Microsoft WIN32:
   You are now looking at the source distribution.  A precompiled ldap.pyd 
   for WIN32 architectures can also be found at:

   	http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/dc-prj/ldapmodule/

   If you have MSVC6.0 or equivalent, and want to build the module yourself,
   you should refer to the README.txt file in the win32 directory.

Notes on building for getting started quickly:
   Here are some notes on quickly building an external library (either UM's
   LDAP or OpenLDAP) for *sole* use with this Python module. (You don't
   need to be here if you have already built and installed LDAP libraries.)

   The idea here is to download and compile just enough of those parts
   of the third-party C libraries so that ldapmodule may be compiled
   and installed.

   First, follow one of the package-specific instructions below. After
   doing that, you should have built the essential LDAP library and 
   header files in /tmp/ldap-pfx.
   After doing that you then go back into the ldapmodule directory and
   tell configure where to find everything with something like this:

   	$ sh configure --with-ldap=/tmp/ldap-pfx
	$ make

   If you have problems building shared libraries, remove the '*shared*'
   from the Setup file and re-make.

   After building and installing ldapmodule, you can delete /tmp/ldap-pfx.

 OpenLDAP (release 1.2.1 or higher)
   [There is a shell script included, openldap.sh, that tries to do the
    following steps automatically.]
   1. Download and extract the release source code (from the download page at 
      http://www.openldap.org/ or from 
      ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/openldap-release/)
   2. Create a directory such as /tmp/ldap-pfx that will be used to hold the
      built libraries.
      $ mkdir -p /tmp/ldap-pfx/lib /tmp/ldap-pfx/include
   3. Run the configure script from within the extracted 'ldap' directory:
      $ sh configure --help   			# (read the options carefully)
   4. $ sh configure --prefix=/tmp/ldap-pfx --disable-slapd --disable-slurpd \
   		   --disable-libui --disable-threads # add other needed options
   7. $ cd include; make && make install
   5. $ cd ../libraries/liblber; make && make install
   6. $ cd ../libldap; make && make install

 UM LDAP (ldap-3.3)
   1. Download and extract ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap.tar.Z
      It unpacked into a directory called ldap-3.3 for me.
   2. Create a directory such as /tmp/ldap-pfx that will be used to hold the 
      built libraries:
      $ mkdir -p /tmp/ldap-pfx/lib /tmp/ldap-pfx/include
   3. Edit Make-common in ldap-3.3, changing INSTROOT to be /tmp/ldap-pfx
   4. Run the makeconfig script from the 'ldap-3.3' directory:
      $ make makeconfig				# bootstrap future makes
   5. $ cd libraries/liblber; make install	# build the BER library
   6. $ cd ../libldap; make install		# build the LDAP library
   7. $ cd ../../include; make install
