Change history for ldapmodule

1.9
	- removed mod_next for RedHat 5.2 <esj%harvee.billerica.ma.us>
	- fixed bug where error objects would sometimes be wrong
	- Works with Solaris 2.7's ldap. (Probably with Netscape's ldap too)
	  but errors are not available. Sun's man pages suck.
	- Use correct form of --without-threads option in openldap.sh 
	  <a.d.stribblehill%durham.ac.uk>
	- correctly use --enable-cidict fix
1.8
	- Exceptions are now classes with a common base class (ldap.LDAPError)
	  <davidma%premier1.net>

	- catch two possible null pointer dereferences
1.7
	(No code changes, just install fixes)
	- install notes cleanup
	- public domain
	- fix bug exposed by RedHat Linux 5.2: get extra libs from

	- support for OpenLDAP 1.2.7
	- openldap.sh does MD5 checksum (for corrupted downloads mainly)
1.6
	- added experimental 'case insensitive' dictionary, meaning that
	  attributes records returned can be indexed by case-insensitive
	  attribute names
	- added a shell script called openldap.sh which downloads, configures,
	  and builds the essentials from an OpenLDAP distribution
1.5
	- better type checking
	- documentation in __doc__ strings
	- support for WIN32 compilation
	- README tells how to do a minimum-build of the OpenLDAP distribution
1.4
	- python 1.5 savvy
	- uses a configure script
	- README tells how to do a minimum-build of UM's ldap distribution

	- added 'unbind()' method and 'valid' attribute
1.0
	- no changes
0.4
	- fixed bug where ldap_explode_dn would fail and exception wasn't
	  indicative of real error (bad DN)
	- fixed bug where ldap_get_dn would fail and exception wasn't raised
	- fixed bug where None passed as attribute list to modify would
	  fail to initialise a pointer and seg fault later on

0.2
	- thread support
0.1
