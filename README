    :alt: Continuous integration status

pyldap is a fork of the excellent ``python-ldap`` Python project.

The goals of this fork are the following:

* Bring Python 3 support to ``python-ldap`` while keeping a PY2-compatible codebase
* Improve tooling and code quality
* Keep backwards compatibility whenever possible

-----------------------
Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Users should be able to replace ``python-ldap`` with ``pyldap`` with minimal impact on their code.
According to this, releases of ``pyldap`` will stick to the numbering of the upstream ``python-ldap`` releases they are based on.

However, some compatibility toggles will be added to bring cleaner APIs for PY3 code.

Please note the ``pyldap`` installs under the same ``ldap`` module as ``python-ldap``; it **CANNOT** be installed alongside.


--------------------------
Upgrading from python-ldap
--------------------------

``pyldap`` brings some improvements on top of ``python-ldap``.


Bytes/text management
=====================

The LDAP protocol states that some fields (distinguised names, relative distinguished names,
attribute names, queries) be encoded in UTF-8; some other (mostly attribute *values*) **MAY**
contain any type of data, and thus be treated as bytes.

However, ``python-ldap`` used bytes for all fields, including those guaranteed to be text.
In order to support Python 3, ``pyldap`` needs to make this distinction explicit; this is done
through the ``bytes_mode`` flag to ``ldap.initialize()``.

When porting from ``python-ldap``, users are advised to update their code to set ``bytes_mode=False``
on calls to these methods.
Under Python 2, ``pyldap`` checks aggressively the type of provided arguments, and will raise a ``TypeError``
for any invalid parameter; however, if the ``bytes_mode`` kwarg isn't provided, ``pyldap`` will only
raise warnings.

The typical usage is as follow; note that only the result's *values* are of the bytes type:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import ldap
    >>> con = ldap.initialize('ldap://localhost:389', bytes_mode=False)
    >>> con.simple_bind_s('login', 'secret_password')
    >>> results = con.search_s('ou=people,dc=example,dc=org', ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(cn=Raphaël)")
    >>> results
    [
        ("cn=Raphaël,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org", {
            'cn': [b'Rapha\xc3\xabl'],
            'sn': [b'Barrois'],
        }),
    ]

python-ldap: LDAP client API for Python
---------------------------------------

What is python-ldap?
====================

python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP
directory servers from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the
OpenLDAP client libs for that purpose.

Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related
stuff (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 sub-schema, etc.).

Not included: Direct BER support

See INSTALL for version compability

See TODO for planned features. Contributors welcome.

For module documentation, see:

	http://www.python-ldap.org/

Quick usage example:
====================

.. code-block:: python

    import ldap
    l = ldap.initialize("ldap://my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

See directory ``Demo/`` of source distribution package for more
example code.
